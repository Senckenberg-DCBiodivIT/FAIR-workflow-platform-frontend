<b>Data Protection</b><br />
<br />
The protection of personal data is very important to the SGN. Therefore, the SGN collects and processes your data on this website exclusively in accordance with the European provisions of the Basic Data Protection Regulations (DSGVO) in accordance with the new Federal Data Protection (BDSG-neu) and the Telemedia Act (TMG) for the SGN’s association-related purposes. The SGN therefore only collects, uses, and passes on personal data if this is permitted by law, or if you give consent for the data collection.<br />
<br />
<b>Legal Basis for the Processing of Data according to the DSGVO</b><br />
<br />
The obtaining of consent is regulated by Article 6, Paragraph 1 a and Article 7 of the DSGVO; the legal basis for the processing in order to conduct contractual measures and for the reply to inquiries is 6, Paragraph 1 b of the DSGVO. The processing for the fulfilment of legal obligations occurs in accordance with Article 6, Paragraph 1 c of the DSGVO. The legal basis for the processing to safeguard Senckenberg‘s legitimate interests is Article 6, Paragraph 1 f of the DSGVO. In the event that the essential interests of the affected person or another natural person require the processing of personal data, Article 6, Paragraph 1 d of the DSGVO applies.<br />
<br />
At Senckenberg, this primarily involves the collection, storage, and processing of your contact and user data for the mailing of donation receipts for your charitable donations in accordance with Article 6, Paragraph 1 b of the DSGVO, for the cooperation with associated companies for the donation management and direct debit at the bank, the mailing of the SGN newsletter, subject to your consent according to Article 6, Paragraph 1 a, for the provision of the online content, maintaining the website’s functionality, and for marketing according to Article 6, Paragraph 1 f of the DSGVO. Beyond that, we principally do not pass on your data to any third parties, in accordance with Article 6, Paragraph 1 b of the DSGVO. <br />
<br />
<b>Transmission into Third Countries</b>
<br />
Data will only be processed in a third country (i.e., outside the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA)) if this is required for the fulfilment of contractual obligation, based on your consent, due to a legal obligation, or on the basis of our legitimate interests. The data will only be processed in a third country in the presence of the special conditions outlined in Article 44 et seq. of the DSGVO (officially recognized determination of a data protection level in keeping with EU regulations, e.g., by the “Privacy Shield” in the USA or officially recognized, special contractual obligations, so-called “standard contract clauses”).<br />
<br />
<b>Consent and Right to Objection</b><br />
<br />
You can informally object to the use of your data at any time. Under certain conditions according to Article 15 et seq. of the DSGVO, you further have the right to information, correction, blocking, and deletion of the data stored by us.<br />
For this purpose, please contact us via e-mail at datenschutz@senckenberg.de or via regular mail to<br />

<br />
Moreover, according to Article 77 of the DSGVO in conjunction with § 40 of the BDSG-neu, under certain conditions you have the right to file a complaint with a supervisory authority.<br />
<br />
<b>Personal Data</b><br />
<br />
Personal data involve all information regarding your personal or factual circumstances that can be used to identify a person. This includes information such as your name, mailing address, telephone number, and e-mail address. Information that cannot be directly associated with your true identity (e.g., length of visit to a website or number of website users that cannot be associated with your IP address) do not fall in this category.<br />
<br />
Moreover, transmitted personal data will not be passed on to third parties, unless this is urgently required by law. They are deleted upon conclusion of the business process and expiry of the legal retention requirements, in accordance with the statutory provisions.<br />
<br />
<b>Server Logfiles/Access Data</b><br />
<br />
Access to the websites of this internet presence is logged in accordance with Article 6, Paragraph 1 f of the DSGVO in conjunction with the BDSG-neu. This includes: name of the website, file name, date and time of access, transmitted data volume, browser type, the user’s operating system, referrer URL, and IP address. The data are analyzed for statistical purposes and to improve the content offer. They are deleted at regular intervals. The provisions of the TMG apply.<br />
<br />
<b>Incorporation of third-party Services and Content</b><br />
<br />
It is possible that third-party online content such as YouTube videos, maps by Google Maps, RSS feeds, or graphics from other websites will be incorporated in our online content. This always requires that the content provider (hereafter referred to as third-party provider) records the user’s IP address, since the content cannot be transmitted to the respective user’s browser without the IP address. The IP address is therefore necessary for the display of the content. We make an effort to only offer content by providers that will use the IP address exclusively for the provision of this content. However, we have no influence over the possibility that a third-party provider may store the IP address for statistical purposes, etc.  To the extent that this is known to us, we will inform the user in this regard.<br />
<br />
<b>Storage Limits</b><br />
<br />
All personal data will be deleted immediately after conclusion of their processing purpose.<br />
<br />
<b>Data Protection Notice According to § 13 of the TMG</b><br />
<br />
According to the provisions of the TMG, we point out that all personal data transmitted to us via this website will not be processed and stored beyond the time period required for the service provision, and not to an extent that exceeds the data volume essentially necessary for the service provision.<br />
<br />
<b>Copyright</b><br />
<br />
All content, images, and graphics are protected by copyright and may only be used with the written permission of the respective copyright holder.<br />
<br />
<b>Liability for Links</b><br />
<br />
Our content includes links to third-party external web pages (e.g., YouTube), over whose content we have no influence. To display the content, your IP address is transmitted to the third party. The SGN cannot accept any liability for this foreign content and compliance with the data protection regulations. The content of the linked pages is always the sole responsibility of the websites’ respective content provider or operator.<br />
<br />
<b>Imprint</b><br />
<br />
The use of contact data published in the context of the obligation to provide an imprint by third parties for the mailing of unsolicited advertisements and information materials is hereby expressly prohibited. The operator of the websites expressly reserve the right to take legal action in case of the unsolicited mailing of advertising information, e.g., by means of spam e-mails.<br />
